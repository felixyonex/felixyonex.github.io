# Personal website of Felix

- This is my personal website.
- I built this with boilerplate, fullpage, HTML and CSS and JavaScript.
- With responsive design, this website can be viewed on desktop and mobile device.
- Most of the animation is realized by CSS3 and a small part is done by JavaScript.

## DEMO

1. This site is built with fullpage, so it consists of four vertical slides. You just need to scroll down.

2. You can click the project and redirect to my GitHub Repository.

3. This is a responsive website. So you can change the size of your window, or view it on the mobile device.
